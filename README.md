This document is an analysis of Blinkit a grocery shopping company that is established in Gurgoan.Because of its higher demand among the houses of Delhi and Gurgoan, I wondered show much sales they would be doing 
on the basis of their different outlets, their locations, Grocery categories, customer ratings and also on the basis of Fat category.
So, i dive into the data by collecting Blinkit data summary from 2011-2022.
I started my analysis by doing Cleaning of the data removing any short forms, null value in the columns that i need.
After that i started Data Processing, although i did not needed to add any extra columns according to the requirements.
Than i did the initialization of my Data Analysis with the help of Pivot tables I compared sales with several different factors like How much is the total sales for each different location of the outlet.
After doing all my analysis i started my data visualization, by making dashboard for Blinkit and transforming all my analysis data in the form of different charts and icluded 3 filter to easy access to some main points.
